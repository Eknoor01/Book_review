<h3>Review</h3>
<p>For people who want to enjoy an intriguing, fast paced novel, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the
perfect book to read. It keeps you involved throughout the book as most chapters have cliffhangers at the end.
This novel is the first of the seven famous Harry Potter books by J.K. Rowling.</p>
<p>The book is about 11 year old Harry Potter, who receives a letter saying that he is invited to attend Hogwarts, school of witchcraft and
wizardry. He then learns that a powerful wizard and his minions are after the sorcerer's stone that will make this evil wizard immortal and
undefeatable. Harry decides to go after the sorcerer's stone before the wizard reaches it, but his loyal friends, Hermione and Ron don't let
Harry face this danger alone.</p>
<p>This book is full of fantasies and imagination like at one point, Harry Potter is asked to catch a flying golden ball while flying on his
broomstick. Eventually Harry Potter stands on his broomstick and tries to reach for the ball, but he falls off the broomstick in a very tense
moment. He unexpectedly throws up the golden ball winning the game for his team.</p>

    <h3>Author</h3>
    <p>F. Scott Fitzgerald</p>
    <h3>Rating</h3>
    <p>4.5 stars = Really Good</p>
    <h3>Review</h3>
    <p>The story is narrated by Nick Carraway, a Yale graduate and World War I veteran who moves to Long Island's North Shore to learn about the bond business. He rents a modest house in West Egg, a wealthy but unfashionable area populated by the new rich who lack the social connections and pedigree of the East Egg crowd.</p>
    <p>Nick's neighbor is the enigmatic Jay Gatsby, a self-made millionaire known for his lavish parties. Despite his wealth, Gatsby remains a mysterious figure, driven by a single dream: to reunite with Daisy Buchanan, Nick's cousin and Gatsby's former lover, now married to the wealthy but brutish Tom Buchanan.
    
        The novel intricately weaves a story of love, betrayal, and the American Dream. Gatsby's pursuit of Daisy is emblematic of his larger quest for success and recognition. However, as Nick learns more about Gatsby's past and the reality behind his façade, he realizes that Gatsby's dream is fundamentally flawed and unattainable.</p>
    <p>"The Great Gatsby" is a masterful depiction of the American Dream's dark side, highlighting the illusions and disillusionments that come with the pursuit of wealth and status. Fitzgerald's novel remains relevant for its exploration of themes that continue to resonate in contemporary society, such as the quest for identity, the nature of success, and the moral cost of ambition.
    
        In summary, "The Great Gatsby" is a timeless classic that offers a profound critique of the American Dream, wrapped in a tragic love story and set against the backdrop of a fascinating historical era. Its enduring appeal lies in its complex characters, evocative prose, and the timeless truths it uncovers about human nature and society.</p>

        <h3>Review</h3>
        <p>In ancient times the Rings of Power were crafted by the Elven-smiths, and Sauron, the Dark Lord, forged the One Ring, filling it with his own power so that he could rule all others. But the One Ring was taken from him, and though he sought it throughout Middle-earth, it remained lost to him. After many ages it fell by chance into the hands of the hobbit Bilbo Baggins.</p>
        <p>From Sauron's fastness in the Dark Tower of Mordor, his power spread far and wide. Sauron gathered all the Great Rings to him, but always he searched for the One Ring that would complete his dominion.
        
            When Bilbo reached his eleventy-first birthday he disappeared, bequeathing to his young cousin Frodo the Ruling Ring and a perilous quest: to journey across Middle-earth, deep into the shadow of the Dark Lord, and destroy the Ring by casting it into the Cracks of Doom.</p>
        <p>The Lord of the Rings tells of the great quest undertaken by Frodo and the Fellowship of the Ring: Gandalf the Wizard; the hobbits Merry, Pippin, and Sam; Gimli the Dwarf; Legolas the Elf; Boromir of Gondor; and a tall, mysterious stranger called Strider.</p>

            <h3>Review</h3>
            <p>Journeys to the end of the world, fantastic creatures, and epic battles between good and evil—what more could any reader ask for in one book? The book that has it all is The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, written in 1949 by Clive Staples Lewis. But Lewis did not stop there. Six more books followed, and together they became known as The Chronicles of Narnia.</p>
            <p>For the past fifty years, The Chronicles of Narnia have transcended the fantasy genre to become part of the canon of classic literature. Each of the seven books is a masterpiece, drawing the reader into a land where magic meets reality, and the result is a fictional world whose scope has fascinated generations.</p>
            <p>This edition presents all seven books—unabridged—in one impressive volume. The books are presented here in chronlogical order, each chapter graced with an illustration by the original artist, Pauline Baynes. Deceptively simple and direct, The Chronicles of Narnia continue to captivate fans with adventures, characters, and truths that speak to readers of all ages, even fifty years after they were first published.</p>

                <p>Humans and half-bloods agree-Percy Jackson and the Olympians is a series fit for heroes! Relive the adventure from the beginning with this boxed set of the first three books with glorious new cover art by John Rocco.</p>
                <p>The Lightning Thief<br>
                    Percy Jackson is a good kid, but he can't seem to focus on his schoolwork or control his temper. When his mom tells him the truth about where he came from, she takes him to the one place he'll be safe-Camp Half-Blood, a summer camp for demigods (on Long Island). There, Percy learns that the father he never knew is actually Poseidon, God of the Sea. Soon Percy finds himself caught up in a mystery that could lead to disastrous consequences. Together with his friends-a satyr and other the demigod daughter of Athena-Percy sets out on a quest to reach the gates of the Underworld (located in a recording studio in Hollywood) and prevent a catastrophic war between the gods.
                    </p>
                <p>The Sea of Monsters<br>
                    After a summer spent trying to prevent a catastrophic war among the Greek gods, Percy Jackson finds his seventh-grade school year unnervingly calm. But things don't stay quiet for long. Percy soon discovers there is trouble at Camp Half-Blood: the magical borders which protect Half-Blood Hill have been poisoned by a mysterious enemy, and the only safe haven for demigods is on the verge of being overrun by mythological monsters. To save the camp, Percy needs the help of his best friend, Grover, who has been taken prisoner by the Cyclops Polyphemus on an island somewhere in the Sea of Monsters-the dangerous waters Greek heroes have sailed for millennia-only today, the Sea of Monsters goes by a new nameL: the Bermuda Triangle. Now Percy and his friends must retrieve the Golden Fleece from the Island of the Cyclopes by the end of the summer or Camp Half-Blood will be destroyed. But first, Percy will learn a stunning new secret about his family-one that makes him question whether being claimed as Poseidon's son is an honor or simply a cruel joke...</p>
                <p>The Titan's Curse<br>
                    When Percy Jackson receives a distress call from his friend Grover, he immediately prepares for battle. He knows he'll need his powerful demigod allies, Annabeth and Thalia, at his side; his trusty broze sword Riptide; and... a ride from his mom. The demigods race to the rescue, to find that Grover has made an important discovery: two new powerful half-bloods whose parentage is unknown. But that's not all that awaits them. The Titan lord, Kronos, has set up his most devious trap yet, and the young heroes have unwittingly fallen prey. Hilarious and action-packed, this third adventure in the series finds Percy faced with his most dangerous challenge so far: the chilling prophecy of the Titan's curse.</p>

                    <img style="width: 200px;" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91F4amRqOEL._AC_UF1000,1000_QL80_.jpg" alt="">
                    <h3>Author</h3>
                    <p>Smith, L. J.</p>
                    <h3>Rating</h3>
                    <p>4 stars = Really Good</p>
                    <h3>Review</h3>
                    <p>L.J. Smith's "The Vampire Diaries" series, first published between 1991 and 1992 with subsequent books added in the 2000s, is a thrilling saga that blends romance, supernatural elements, and the eternal struggle between good and evil. Spanning over several books, the series captures the tumultuous lives of its characters, weaving together themes of love, power, and redemption against the backdrop of a small town plagued by dark forces.
                    
                        The story is set in the fictional town of Fell's Church, Virginia, and centers around Elena Gilbert, a high school girl who becomes entangled in a love triangle with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon Salvatore. The series kicks off with "The Awakening," where Elena, the quintessential popular girl, finds herself irresistibly drawn to the mysterious and brooding Stefan. As their romance blossoms, the arrival of Stefan's dangerously charming brother, Damon, introduces a new level of complexity and danger.</p>
                    <p>As the series progresses, Elena's relationships with Stefan and Damon deepen, revealing a rich tapestry of past lives, hidden secrets, and supernatural conflicts. "The Struggle" and "The Fury" continue to build on this dynamic, showcasing Elena's transformation from a typical teenager into a courageous heroine willing to face the darkness head-on. The fourth book, "Dark Reunion," serves as a dramatic conclusion to the original series, bringing together the characters for a final showdown against malevolent forces.
                    
                        In the later installments, including "The Return" trilogy and "The Hunters" trilogy, the narrative expands further, exploring new realms and introducing additional supernatural elements such as witches, werewolves, and original vampires. These books delve deeper into the mythos of the vampire world, adding layers of complexity to the characters' struggles and relationships. The stakes are higher, and the dangers more intense, as Elena and her friends confront ancient evils and uncover hidden truths about their town and themselves.</p>
                    <p>One of the strengths of "The Vampire Diaries" series is its character development. Elena evolves from a self-centered teenager into a resilient and compassionate leader. Stefan, the tortured soul seeking redemption, and Damon, the anti-hero with a heart, offer contrasting yet complementary portraits of the vampire archetype. Supporting characters like Bonnie, the psychic witch, and Matt, the loyal friend, add depth and diversity to the narrative, enriching the world Smith has created.
                    
                        Smith's writing style is engaging and accessible, making it easy for readers to become absorbed in the world of Fell's Church. Her ability to balance romance, action, and suspense keeps the pages turning, while the exploration of themes such as identity, loyalty, and the nature of evil adds substance to the story. The series is also notable for its atmospheric setting, with the town of Fell's Church providing a suitably eerie and evocative backdrop for the supernatural events.
                        
                        While "The Vampire Diaries" series is often compared to other vampire-centric works like "Twilight," it distinguishes itself through its intricate plotlines and the moral ambiguity of its characters. The love triangle at the heart of the series is compelling, with Elena's shifting affections and the brothers' rivalry providing a steady undercurrent of tension and drama. Additionally, the series' blend of horror and romance appeals to a wide audience, from young adult readers to fans of gothic fiction.</p>
